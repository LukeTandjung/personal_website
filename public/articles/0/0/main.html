        You can imagine that when I first got into software engineering, and
        started designing my own user interfaces, I had the horrifically
        misguided yet not entirely unreasonable impression that I would have an
        easier time because of basic design foundations I had established in my
        earlier years.

        It’s been a few years since that first UI design. Since then, I’ve taken
        several more cracks at it, and have made some progress. Heck, the
        designs for my personal website was the first time I didn’t violently
        convulse at how ugly it looked. I was even slightly proud of it!

        It wasn't until I got nerd-sniped into Linux ricing did I start
        attempting to answer this question again.

      <p class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default">
        The catalyst for getting sucked into Linux ricing was finding my old
        2017 Macbook Air I had used in high school. This toaster had seen better
        days, and at that point, I was not even sure if it was possible to
        update it to MacOS Sequoia 15 without it spontaneously bursting into
        flames. So I made the executive decision to strip MacOS from it and
        install the NixOS Linux distribution on it.

        The term “ricing” was a holdover term from the car enthusiast scene,
        which stood for “Race Inspired Cosmetic Enhancement”. It was used to
        refer to cosmetic car modifications that made the car look like it ran
        faster (like a car spoiler). In the same sense, Linux ricing refers to
        making your Linux setup look pretty to impress onlookers sufficiently,
        so that they forgot that you probably installed it on your toaster to
        get some extra juice out of it.

        I thorougly enjoyed ricing my Macbook Air. I enjoyed it so much that I
        went through the painstaking process of doing it on my Mac Mini.

      <p class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default">
        Let’s start with how minecraft building design works.
      </p>
      <p class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default">
        A minecraft builder at core aims to build a creative setting that is
        plausibly realistic. My favourite example of this is a factory built
        from musical instruments, built by Blockworks Inc.
      </p>
      <figure class="typst flex justify-center my-4" data-numbering="none">
        <img src="/assets/aeternium.jpg" className="typst-image w-[85%]" />
      </figure>
      <p class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default">
        In such a vast sandbox game unconstrained by material reality, it might
        seem alittle unimaginative to guide our building process through the
        lens of realism. But it is exactly this lens of “can this plausibly
        exist” that allows for <strong>secondary belief</strong> when looking at
        a minecraft build, lending to greater immersion in the more fantastical
        parts of the build.
      </p>
      <p class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default">
        <strong>Definition</strong> (Secondary belief): A term coined by
        Tolkien, it refers to the genuine, immersive belief a reader experiences
        within a fictional world that allows them to accept its internal reality
        and fantastical elements. This hinges on having consistent and deep
        rules set by the author, producing immersion that goes beyond suspense
        of disbelief.
      </p>
      <p class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default">
        To this end, Minecraft builders layer realistic visual cues. If you come
        from a design background, this might sound familiar to you. Minecraft
        building design sounds similar, in principle, to
        <strong>skeumorphism</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default">
        <strong>Definition</strong> (Skeumorphism): A design style with visual
        cues (or affordances) that imitate the texture, shape, or function of
        physical objects.
      </p>
      <p class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default">
        We can draw parallels between Minecraft builders and UI designers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li
          class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default list-disc list-inside"
        >
          Minecraft builders layer realistic visual cues in an abstract digital
          medium (blocks) to generate secondary belief in their setting, then
          add in their own creative elements.
        </li>
        <li
          class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default list-disc list-inside"
        >
          UI designers layer skeumorphic cues in an abstract digital medium
          (screen plane) to anchor user understanding, then add in their own
          brand elements.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default">
        While helpful, this comparison is still abstract. After all,
      </p>
      <blockquote
        class="flex justify-center my-4 font-mono font-normal text-sm text-char-alt"
      >
        …what does layering "cues" look like in practice?
      </blockquote>
      <p class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default">
        In Minecraft builds, it shows up as a handful of building principles we
        utilise to organise these visual cues, and make the build look pretty.
        While the epistemic origins of such principles are unknown, being
        informally taught and passed down from builder to builder, it does bear
        an uncanny resemblance to a fusion of Gestalt design principles and art
        theory. Some of the more relevant Minecraft building principles that
        have interesting stylistic implications to UI design are as follows:
      </p>
      <h2 class="font-serif font-medium text-xl text-char-default">Depth</h2>
      <p class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default">
        A wall in Minecraft with depth almost always looks better than a flat
        wall. However, there are challenges when it comes to translating this
        idea from a 3D voxel space to a 2D screen plane. Thankfully, there are
        multiple way to create an illusion of depth within flat walls in
        Minecraft.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li
          value="1"
          class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default list-decimal list-inside"
        >
          <strong>Shadows</strong>: This is something already utilised in
          skeumorphic or neumorphic design styles.
        </li>
        <li
          value="2"
          class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default list-decimal list-inside"
        >
          <strong>Colour</strong>: Colours of darker values for parts of the
          wall you want to give the illusion of depth for. This naturally gives
          rise to a colour hierarchy, Unlike traditional UI design where colour
          hierarchy is used solely for semantic prioritisation, we now use it to
          imply physical depth in a 2D screen.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="font-serif font-mediumn text-xl text-char-default">Colour</h2>
      <p class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default">
        A block palette is to your Minecraft build what a colour palette is to a
        UI design. A popular colour palette for UI design is the 60-30-10 colour
        palette.
      </p>
      <figure class="flex justify-center my-4">
        <img src="/assets/60_30_10.png" class="typst-image w-[60%]" />
      </figure>
      <p class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default">
        However, a Minecraft build usually has a larger palette than the
        60-30-10 colour palette. While a build is doable with a 60-30-10 colour
        palette, Minecraft builds in general look better with more colour
        variation. A more suitable colour palette that would translate better
        from Minecraft builds to UI design would be the base16 or even the
        base24 colour palette. This is a colour palette type that is often used
        in Linux desktop ricing.
      </p>
      <h2 class="font-serif font-medium text-xl text-char-default">Texture</h2>
      <p class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default">
        Texture gives any surface a material quality to it, influencing the feel
        of the build. From the texture of a single block to creating a specific
        texture like gradients with multiple blocks, this translates well in UI
        design! One way we can utilise this is to create grainy background
        gradients for our UI.
      </p>
      <p class="font-mono font-normal text-base text-char-default">
        To summarise the Minecraft building design logic, Minecraft building
        principles are organised to produce realistic cues, which provides a
        strong foundation for secondary belief in this creative setting. We now
        have the foundations to attempt to create a design system inspired from
        Minecraft builds.
