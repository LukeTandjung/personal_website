      <p>It’s been twenty five years since I materialised into existence. I don’t have much to show for it.</p>
      <p>My first twenty one years in Singapore suggest otherwise. The Singaporean in me would point to grade transcripts, a litany of extra-curricular activities, papered leadership positions. Look, the Singaporean in me would exclaim: you’ve done something with your life! You didn’t waste it! You spent your time playing the game(TM) and climbing the ladder correctly.</p>
      <p>It’s all meaningfully fake.</p>
      <p>I’ve known for a very long time that it’s fake. Very little of what I did in those first twenty one years mattered. It wasn’t revelatory, it wasn’t transformative, it didn’t give me that one epiphany I needed to completely turn my life around.</p>
      <p>The part that stung the most, however, wasn’t the fact that I climbed a meaningless status ladder. It was the fact that there were people out there my age who didn’t climb it, and were radiantly exceptional regardless. People whom I met for the first time when I left the Singapore bubble and studied overseas.</p>
      <p>The outliers.</p>
      <p>People who violate the laws of cause and effect: where their achievements are merely the effortless byproduct of their exceptionalism, instead of their exceptionalism being defined by achievements.</p>
      <p>People who had that agentic or genius X factor that allowed them to operate beyond the mundane dimensions of “working hard enough” or “working smart enough”.</p>
      <p>People who simply rewrote the laws of the world to make the impossible possible.</p>
      <p>I still remember the first time I met people like that. I felt something particularly rare for a sheltered boy living in a safe, high-functioning first world country.</p>
      <p>Fear.</p>
      <p>Fear in the face of overwhelming, unquantifiable greatness.</p>
      <p>And the fear that deep down, I was never going to be like them.</p>
      <p>So I took a crack at it, and started raging against the machinations that made me, me.</p>
      <p>In the process, I carved a monument to all my failures:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li value="1">
          I took two years to launch a shitty automated dieting app (my first idea) with a Bubble frontend and a backend that broke regularly.
        </li>
        <li value="2">
          The love of my life - the one I thought I was going to marry - left as unexpectedly as she came, putting an end to a two-year relationship.
        </li>
        <li value="3">
          Two months ago, I got laid off from a startup in one of the most brutal tech markets in recent memory.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>So what does a twenty-five year old loser with no job, no romantic prospects, less than two months of runway for living expenses, and four years into figuring out how to take a startup from 0 to 1 with nothing to show for it do?</p>
      <p>He crashes out.</p>
      <p>And crash out he did, on a chance application for a hacker house he discovered on his “For You” page on X.</p>
      <p>Except this time, instead of rejecting him like the countless other entrepreneurial initiatives he applied to because he didn’t have enough shiny outlier credentials to show off, they decided to give him a chance — and let him in.</p>
      <p>I’ve always felt like I live off the kindness of other people. It’s a sick irony, because one of the strongest worldviews I hold myself to is to never bet on the kindness of other people.</p>
      <p>Rely on yourself. Sharpen yourself into a terrifying weapon of ruthless competence that can affect the world the way you see fit.</p>
      <p>And yet, whenever some random stranger shows me a little kindness, I always feel a pang of guilt:</p>
      <blockquote class="flex justify-center my-4 font-mono font-normal text-sm text-char-alt">I don't deserve this kindness, why are you helping me?</blockquote>
      <p>This irony is usually worsened by the fact that every time I experience such unmerited kindness, my personal development leapfrogs and I grow tremendously as a person.</p>
      <p>When I was fifteen, I joined a debate initiative that not only leapfrogged my debating ability, but also gave me the most tight-knit community of reassurance and love that fundamentally altered the way I view, and value friendship.</p>
      <p>And now, at twenty-five, I got to experience it again.</p>
      <p>In three weeks, the hacker house destroyed my ego and built me up from scratch.</p>
      <p>It made me confront fears I’d been running from, and shattered the old mindset holding me back.</p>
      <p>It fundamentally altered my worldview on creating and running startups.</p>
      <p>It gave me a sense of direction, and patterns I can finally start to match to deepen my understanding of myself.</p>
      <p>But most importantly of all, I found my people. I found a peer group with such deep alignment to my fundamental sense of self - something I haven’t felt in ten years - and people I genuinely look up to and love from the bottom of my heart.</p>
      <p>So what did I actually learn? Here are the insights that broke me down and built me back up.</p>
      <p>If I had to choose the most radicalising insight, it would be about what startups fundamentally are. At core, it’s not about being skilled at moving the needle on a marketing channel, or how much product-market fit your product has. Sure, those matter. But they miss the forest for the trees:</p>
      <blockquote class="flex justify-center my-4 font-mono font-normal text-sm text-char-alt">...running a startup is just pain</blockquote>
      <p>This singular idea is radicalising because it simplifies the equation of entrepreneurship. It explains the most common failure mode of startups: founders give up. It explains why founders don’t find product-market fit, or why they can’t raise funding.</p>
      <p>They simply couldn’t push through the pain.</p>
      <p>Enduring pain you cannot forecast the magnitude of, for an indefinite period of time, is easier said than done. But if anything, it presents the clearest north star you can have as an entrepreneur.</p>
      <p>What is the number one problem your startup is facing?</p>
      <p>For such a simple question, it is deceptively hard to answer. For one reason alone — it is hard to be truthful with ourselves. It’s easy to trick ourselves into solving problems we’re already comfortable solving. Maybe that problem is the second or third hardest, which means it’s still relatively high on the trash heap.</p>
      <p>But the number one problem is special. It is the type of problem without which your startup cannot progress.</p>
      <p>For me, the number one takes on a qualia fundamentally different from any other problem. It is deeply tied to the personal — a fundamental limitation I was running away from. I realised that by picking anything other than the number one problem, I was just laundering my cowardice through the lens of productivity.</p>
      <p>I need to stare into the void and confront the hardest problem head-on.</p>
      <p>I should not be afraid to put my face on the internet.</p>
      <p>This is honestly the hardest thing I’ve yet to get over. It’s one thing to be seen in the prose you write, in the margins where you pour yourself out. Writing is something I’m comfortable with. We’ve been writing our whole lives — the muscle memory of penning down your thoughts is something everyone has.</p>
      <p>But I’ve never filmed a video of myself on my own initiative. I’ve always cringed at the videos I’m in.</p>
      <p>With writing, you can draft it over and over until it strikes the right balance between polish and your own personal voice. You’re judged on the quality of the writing, and the ideas you present.</p>
      <p>But when you film yourself and put it on the internet, you’re perceived and judged in ways that may not be fair. Your ideas can be overshadowed by your presentation. You will never be truly satisfied with how you come across. There are so many ways it can go wrong.</p>
      <p>And yet, there is no better judgment for the soul than to be (literally!) seen.</p>
      <p>It’s why I created my personal website and started blogging on it.</p>
      <p>If I truly want to be seen for who I am - the good, the bad, the beautiful, and the ugly - I should bare my soul and subject it to the unrelenting scrutiny of the wider internet.</p>
      <p>I just have to take the next step.</p>
      <p>My heart still quivers with anxiety as I type this, at the thought of what I have to do next. It’s scary to venture into the unknown, after all.</p>
      <p>Somewhere along the way, after failing so much, I grew complacent. I started hedging. I started running away from who I wanted to become. I lied to myself, whispering sweet nothings to protect myself from the pain of failure.</p>
      <p>The problem is, the pain of failure doesn’t disappear just because you run from it. Living a life of complacent, quiet desperation doesn’t make it go away. All it does is manifest in a lifetime of regrets and what-ifs. A misplaced frustration. A growing weariness. The voice in your heart pleading with you to do the one thing you’ve always wanted to do.</p>
      <p>The pain of failure is so very real. The fear of it doesn’t disappear.</p>
      <p>But my three weeks at the hacker house made me realise that the fear of never living the life I wanted, surrounded by the people I love, doing the work I yearn for deep down, is insurmountably greater.</p>
      <p>So at least now, I have the courage.</p>
      <p>The courage to walk out of the cave.</p>
