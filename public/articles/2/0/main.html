        Your Learning Should Be As Irreverent as Possible
      </h1>
      <p>You want to learn something new.</p>
      <p>
        Maybe you want to learn how to draw, or learn a new language. Maybe you
        want to learn how to cook well.
      </p>
      <p>How do you start? Some obvious answers come to mind.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>A playlist of YouTube tutorials with marked out timestamps?</li>
        <li>
          A structured online course complete with strict learning outcomes, and
          measured timelines?
        </li>
        <li>
          An instructive and deep textbook with assorted numbered chapters?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All these are convenient starting points. They lower the activation
        energy required to spur you into action, and stop you from spinning your
        wheels. For those who are time strapped, this yields the highest return
        on investment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even with all these in mind, I would like to propose something a radical
        idea to anyone reading this the next time they want to learn something
        new:
      </p>
      <p>Ditch the framework, ditch the roadmap, the learning outcomes.</p>
      <p>Ditch it all.</p>
      <p>
        Meander the fields of knowledge with the wanderlust of a budding
        journeyman. Ask with the inquisitive curiosity of a baby just brought
        into conception, conceived into the world. Investigate with the
        truth-seeking greed of the financial market quant looking for their next
        big payout.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should not be afraid of looking stupid. You should not be afraid of
        offending anyone. You should be as free, and as irreverent as possible.
      </p>
      <p>This line of thinking begets a common response:</p>
      <blockquote
        class="flex justify-center my-4 font-mono font-normal text-sm text-char-alt"
      >
        If other people have already separate the wheat from the chaff for us,
        why not just use it?
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Therein lies the problem. Because the wheat is not separated from the
        chaff, for you.
      </p>

        The lesson plan written by the public school teacher is for a class of
        roughly thirty to forty students. The YouTube tutorial scripted and
        filmed by the YouTuber is subject to the pressures of audience capture.
        The short article (the irony is not lost on me!) on a company website is
        all just part of a marketing pipeline to bring leads in.
      </p>
      <blockquote
        class="flex justify-center my-4 font-mono font-normal text-sm text-char-alt"
      >
        In short, nobody really wants to teach you anything.

        And that’s fine. It’s better that way, anyway. All this structure is
        merely an wrapper abstraction over the total sum of knowledge,
        manufactured for the amorphrous impersonal learner. When you stop
        imposing that structure on yourself, you force yourself to be
        explorative, and irreverent. You are no longer constrained by plans and
        timelines other people set for you. Your learning becomes just another
        form of recreation, the same way you feel about going to a club or
        meeting friends for dinner. And like any recreation, you have no
        obligation to it. You don’t feel pressured to continue when you no
        longer feel like doing it.
      </p>
      <p>Getting bored from all the reading? Tired and sleepy?</p>
      <p>Just stop.</p>
      <p>Pick it back up some other time.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, for practicality, you’ll sometimes have to push through
        boring bits even when you don’t want to, or force yourself through
        material that would normally interest you on a better day. But on
        balance, more people probably need to hear this advice than don’t. Most
        people have had their love of a particular subject destroyed by the
        rigors of public education, their attention spans fried by short-form
        content carefully engineered by tech giants to maximize dopamine
        retention and synaptic burnout. If that sounds like you, you probably
        need this.
      </p>

        Let your interest guide you. Find something really interesting? Read up
        on it more deeply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Find something mind-numbingly boring? Learn just enough to get by and
        move on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Free yourself of the obligation to learn from structure that was never
        made for you.
